# CP1404 Assignment 2 - Song List 2.0 by Xiaoyu Shi

A Python project with GUI and Console programs that (re)use classes to manage a list of songs to learn.

# Project Reflection

## 1. How long did the entire project (assignment 2) take you?

-I spent up to 15 hours completing it, prioritizing the completion of "song" and "songcollection". Afterwards, I completed the main function and kv file, and modified the main function file in Assignment1.

## 2. What are you most satisfied with?

-I completed the assignment required by the professor by searching for information, inquiring with classmates, and consolidating my knowledge. It gave me a great sense of achievement.

## 3. What are you least satisfied with?

-This assignment takes too long, and sometimes it takes a lot of time to find out where the problem lies when you see program errors. However, your knowledge is still not very comprehensive, and many small details are overlooked.

## 4. What worked well in your development process?

-I have achieved all the required functions and added annotations, thanks to the teacher's video tutorial class.

## 5. What about your process could be improved the next time you do a project like this?

-I think I can achieve this. With the accumulation of knowledge, I can simplify many steps and divide them into different modules to complete the code in a more organized manner.

## 6. Describe what learning resources you used and how you used them.

-I consolidated my knowledge through previous weekly assignments, contacted the professor's video explanation, searched for similar knowledge points on the Internet of Things, and asked classmates to complete this assignment.

## 7. Describe the main challenges or obstacles you faced and how you overcame them.

1.Design of application architecture: 
In larger projects, designing a reasonable application architecture is crucial. The organizational structure of classes and methods was used in the project, but as the project size increases, more design patterns and organizational structures may be required.

2.Code specification: 
In this large project, attention should be paid to the writing standards of the code. If you don't pay attention, errors will be reported due to code specification issues. Pay attention to where to use "_" and where to use spaces.

3.Data persistence: 
Properly save and load data (such as song lists). To ensure the integrity of the data, it is important to process the files correctly and repeatedly check them.

4.Use Kivy files correctly and create the correct format: 
According to the requirements of the question, where vertical distribution is required and where horizontal distribution is required.

## 8. Briefly describe your experience using classes and if/how they improved your code.

-Using classes in programming can improve code organization. Classes provide a way to encapsulate relevant data and functionality together, making the code more modular, readable, and easy to maintain. For example, in a main application project, classes can represent "Song" and "SongCollection" and reference them into the main program, with each class encapsulating relevant data and operations.
